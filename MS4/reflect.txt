3. While working on milestone 4, we had two different functions that we had to alter our code
to fit and to work around on; getTenDigitPhone and findContactIndex. Milestone 4 introduces the 
use of string functions in order to compare, sort, find the length etc. Both of these two functions
allows the user to find, add, or even delete certain strings in this assignment. The findContactIndex 
function uses the strcmp() command, this allows us to compare between different strings and see if
they are the same or different based on characters, numbers or even occurrences. This function aids the
user to find and return the current position in the contact array. The getTenDigitPhone function tells the 
user to enter a certain number string, 10 and then return the value. This benefits our code because it tells 
the user the exact number we need to find and compare it to. These two functions are an upside to maintenance
and readability because we can call and use these two functions where ever in our code. Another upside is that 
we won't have to declare any another variables or code any certain features in order for us to set or to look for
these variable as these two functions are designed for that reason. 

4. The thing I learned most from while doing assignment 2 is the use for string functions and the use of other
functions. By using other functions we can decrease our workspace as we can always call a function that can do the 
job for us. The thing I learned from string functions is that we can use it to search, compare or even check the 
length of any other string. We can then use this to check, update or delete any string we don't like. This option is
very useful for future use in any business, website, or game related materials.
